# Scientific RAG for Equations architecture

## Purpose

Keep technical answers grounded in explicit source evidence and equation records.

## Current flow

`document → source chunks → evidence records → grounded answer`

## Design rule

Keep domain assumptions at the boundary, keep core utilities deterministic, and keep evaluation separate from training or inference code. Every future model should be compared with the current baseline under the same split and metric definitions.

## Review checklist

- Input units, timestamps, and provenance are documented.
- Training and evaluation information are separated.
- Edge cases have tests.
- Uncertainty or failure behavior is explicit.
- The README states intended use and non-goals.
